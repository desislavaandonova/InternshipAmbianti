**Discover Phase** 
So far in the project, I have engaged in several activities to ensure a clear understanding of the problem and to lay the groundwork for developing an effective online experience showroom for Ambianti L3Ds. 
My initial step was to conduct a thorough problem analysis, which involved breaking down the core challenges of creating a web-based platform that both sells and showcases the unique capabilities of L3D products. This analysis led me to the define a set of research questions that will guide the entire project. These questions are essential for narrowing the focus on user needs, emotional triggers, and market positioning, ensuring that each subsequent step is informed by concrete objectives rather than assumptions.
After identifying the core research questions, I began brainstorming potential methodologies  that could be used to answer them. I took into account not just the methods that would yield the most insightful data but also those that would be time- and resource-efficient given the constraints of the project. This critical thinking about the methods ensures that I will be able to collect meaningful data without overextending the project's budget or timeline. In addition to brainstorming, I did some digging into research methods that I had not previously encountered. Through literature research and consultations with my mentor, I discovered several new methodologies that I plan to apply during the course of the project, such as emotion mapping techniques (Premo cards) and Repertory Grid technique. These methods are designed to help gather deeper insights into how users emotionally engage with products and how they interact with digital spaces over time. Learning these new methods has been a exciting part of the project, as it broadens my skill set and provides new ways to approach UX design problems. I created a task flowchart with the brainstormed methods, which helps me ensure the logical flow between each activity.
Another important step was identifying the risks associated with these activities and building them into the Project Plan . I had to think through potential delays and challenges. By planning for these risks upfront, I was able to build a project schedule that accounts for potential setbacks and ensures I am staying on track. Structing the project plan allowed me to ensure that all phases of the project are aligned and dependencies between tasks are clearly mapped out. For example, I realized that user interviews and competitor analysis must be completed early to inform the design process, and any delay here would affect subsequent phases. By understanding these dependencies, I was able to craft a Dependency Map  for the project, mapping out how the interconnections between each activity.
While constructing the project plan, I created a Gantt Chart with the tasks and created time-frames to help me manage the timing of this project. This chart helps visualize how I will move from the Discover phase, where I am right now, to the Define, Develop, and Deliver phases. Organizing and managing the workflow of the project, ensures that I am meeting deadlines and milestones in a structured and strategic way.
At the latest stage of the project, I’ve been primarily focused on exploring websites to gather inspiration and ideas for the L3D online experience showroom. By browsing competitor websites, digital showrooms, and interactive platforms, I’m starting to form a picture of what works well in showcasing high-tech products like L3Ds. While I haven’t yet created a formal analysis document, this early stage of exploration is already giving me insights into potential features that could enhance the user experience for our showroom. Observing how other companies present their products is helping me identify best practices, but also areas where we can innovate to make the Ambianti showroom stand out. I can see that these insights will play a key role when I move into designing.
